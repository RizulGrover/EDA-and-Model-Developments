End-to-end data analysis and predictive modeling on King County housing dataset.

# House Sales Analysis – King County, USA

This project is part of my data analysis learning journey. I worked through an end-to-end workflow using the King County House Sales dataset (2014–2015). The goal was to explore the data, build predictive models, and understand what features influence house prices.

## What I Did
- Imported and understood the dataset  
- Cleaned the data and handled missing values  
- Performed exploratory data analysis to check trends and correlations  
- Built different regression models (linear and polynomial)  
- Compared their performance using R² scores  
- Visualized key findings and model outputs  

## Key Highlights
- Explored how features like square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, condition, and location affect price  
- Built a baseline Linear Regression model and later tried more complex polynomial models  
- Evaluated and compared models using R² values to understand which one explained price variations better  
- Visualized the fitted models and learning curves to see improvement after refinement  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the Jupyter notebook  
3. Install required libraries (if needed)  
4. Run the notebook top to bottom  

## Dataset
The dataset contains house sale prices across King County, including Seattle.  
(Available on Kaggle or various open repositories.)

## What I Learned
This project helped me practice real-world data analysis steps — cleaning data, EDA, model building, and evaluation. It also gave me a good understanding of how regression models behave with different feature combinations.

## Notebook
The complete notebook is included in this repository.
